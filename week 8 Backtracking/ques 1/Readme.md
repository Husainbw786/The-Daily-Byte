This question is asked by Amazon. Given a string s consisting of only letters and digits, where we are allowed to transform any letter to uppercase or lowercase, return a list containing all possible permutations of the string.      

Ex: Given the following stringâ€¦     

S = "c7w2", return ["c7w2", "c7W2", "C7w2", "C7W2"]
