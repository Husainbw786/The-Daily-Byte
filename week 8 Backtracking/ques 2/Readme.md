This question is asked by Google. Given a string of digits, return all possible text messages those digits could send. Note: The mapping of digits to letters is as followsâ€¦

0 -> null   
1 -> null   
2 -> "abc"   
3 -> "def"  
4 -> "ghi"   
5 -> "jkl"   
6 -> "mno"   
7 -> "pqrs"   
8 -> "tuv"   
9 -> "wxyz"   
Ex: digits = "23"    
 return ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"]
