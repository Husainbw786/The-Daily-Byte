This question is asked by Facebook. Given an integer N, where N represents the number of pairs of parentheses (i.e. ”(“ and ”)”) you are given, return a list containing all possible well-formed parentheses you can create.

Ex: Given the following value of N…

N = 3, 
return [    
    "((()))",   
  "(()())",   
  "(())()",   
  "()(())",  
  "()()()"   
]
