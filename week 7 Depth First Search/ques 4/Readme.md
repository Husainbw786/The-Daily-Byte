Given a binary tree, containing unique values, determine if it is a valid binary search tree.
Note: the invariants of a binary search tree (in our case) are all values to the left of a given node are less than the current node’s value, all values to the right of a given node are greater than the current node’s value, and both the left and right subtrees of a given node must also be binary search trees.

Ex: Given the following binary tree…   

        1
      /   \
     2     3
return false.    
Ex: Given the following tree…

        2
      /   \
     1     3
return true.
