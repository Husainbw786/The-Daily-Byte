Given a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
Note: the maximum depth is defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from root node to leaf node.

Ex: Given the following tree…    


          9       
         / \
        1   2
    return 2    
Ex: Given the following tree…     

             5
            / \
           1  29
             /  \
            4   13
    return 3
