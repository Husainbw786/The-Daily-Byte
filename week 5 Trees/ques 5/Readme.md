Given two binary trees, return whether or not the two trees are identical. Note: identical meaning they exhibit the same structure and the same values at each node. Ex: Given the following trees...

           2
          / \
         1   3
      2
     / \
    1   3

return true.

Ex: Given the following trees...

           1
            \
             9
              \
               18
       1
      /
     9
      \
       18

return false.

Ex: Given the following trees...

            2
           / \
          3   1
       2
      / \
     1   3

return false.
