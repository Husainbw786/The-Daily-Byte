Given a binary search tree, return its mode (you may assume the answer is unique). If the tree is empty, return -1. Note: the mode is the most frequently occurring value in the tree.

Ex: Given the following tree...

        2
       / \
      1   2
return 2.

Ex: Given the following tree...

         7
        / \
      4     9
     / \   / \
    1   4 8   9
               \
                9  
return 9.
