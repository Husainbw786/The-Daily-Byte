Given a binary search tree that contains unique values and two nodes within the tree, a, and b, return their lowest common ancestor.
Note: the lowest common ancestor of two nodes is the deepest node within the tree such that both nodes are descendants of it.

Ex: Given the following tree...   
    7   
   /  \   
  2    9   
 /  \    
1    5   
  
and a = 1, b = 9, return a reference to the node containing 7.
Ex: Given the following tree...

        8
       / \
      3   9
     / \ 
    2   6
and a = 2, b = 6, return a reference to the node containing 3.
Ex: Given the following tree...

        8
       / \
      6   9
and a = 6, b = 8, return a reference to the node containing 8.
