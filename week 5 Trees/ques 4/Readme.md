Given an array of numbers sorted in ascending order, return a height-balanced binary search tree using every number from the array.
Note: height-balanced meaning that the level of any nodeâ€™s two subtrees should not differ by more than one.

Ex: Given the following nums...   

nums = [1, 2, 3] return a reference to the following tree...   
       2   
      /  \   
     1    3   
Ex: Given the following nums...   

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] return a reference to the following tree...   
        3   
       / \   
      2   5   
     /   / \   
    1   4   6
