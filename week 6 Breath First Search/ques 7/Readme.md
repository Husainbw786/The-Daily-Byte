Given a binary tree, return its column order traversal from top to bottom and left to right. Note: if two nodes are in the same row and column, order them from left to right.

Ex: Given the following tree…

         8
        / \
       2   29
          /  \
         3    9
return [[2], [8, 3], [29], [9]]   

Ex: Given the following tree…    

             100
            /   \
          53     78
         / \    /  \
        32  3  9    20
return [[32], [53], [100, 3, 9], [78], [20]]
