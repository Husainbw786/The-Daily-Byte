Given a binary tree, return its level order traversal where the nodes in each level are ordered from left to right.

Ex: Given the following tree...

      4  
     / \  
    2   7   
return [[4], [2, 7]]    
Ex: Given the following tree...

        2 
       / \
      10  15
        \
         20
return [[2], [10, 15], [20]]     
Ex: Given the following tree...   

        1
       / \
      9   32
     /      \
    3        78
return [[1], [9, 32], [3, 78]]
