Given a binary tree, returns of all its levels in a bottom-up fashion (i.e. last level towards the root). Ex: Given the following tree…

        2
       / \
      1   2
return [[1, 2], [2]]   
Ex: Given the following tree…   

          7
         / \
       6    2
      / \ 
     3   3 
return [[3, 3], [6, 2], [7]]
